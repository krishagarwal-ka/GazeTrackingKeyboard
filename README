[1]  Setting Up:
     •  Run 'pip install opencv-python gaze-tracking pyautogui'
     •  Download 'Gaze Tracking.py'
     •  Enable Accesibilty Keyboard from your device setting and position it suitably on your screen.
     •  Run 'Gaze Tracking.py'

[2]  Using the program:
     •  If you get a 'Not Detected' message, reposition yourself in front of the camera until the output changes to 'Centre Centre'
     •  Look around in different directions to move the cursor in that direction.
     •  Blink to left-click
     •  Blink twice (in succession) to right-click
     •  You can use the On-screen Keyboard (Accessibility Keyboard) to type.
     •  Press escape if you wish to stop the program.

[3] Important Information:
     •  Disclaimer: This was an experimental project but it would be phenomenal if it can actually help someone. It has been rigorously tested and works well.
     •  It is recommended to use a high resolution camera for a more reliably experience.
     •  It is highly recommended to maintain adequate (but not too sharp) lighting conditions.
     •  Avoid having mutiple faces in the frame to ensure proper functioning.
     •  Note: It can be strenuous to use the program for long periods of time and it may take a while to get used to the movements.
